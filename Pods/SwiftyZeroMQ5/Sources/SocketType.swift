    /**
        An enumeration of ZeroMQ socket types that maps to a signed 32-bit
        integer. This provides the following patterns:

        - Request-reply pattern (`.request`, `.reply`, `.router`, `.dealer`):

            The request-reply pattern is used for sending requests from a
            `.request` client to one or more `.reply` services, and receiving
            subsequent replies to each request sent. The request-reply pattern
            is formally defined [here](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:28).

        - Publish-subscribe pattern (`.publish`, `.subscribe`, `.xpublish`,
          `.xsubscribe`):

            The publish-subscribe pattern is used for one-to-many distribution
            of data from a single publisher to multiple subscribers in a fan out
            fashion. The publish-subscribe pattern is formally defined
            [here](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:29).

        - Pipeline pattern (`.push`, `.pull`):

            The pipeline pattern is used for distributing data to nodes arranged
            in a pipeline. Data always flows down the pipeline, and each stage
            of the pipeline is connected to at least one node. When a pipeline
            stage is connected to multiple nodes data is round-robined among all
            connected nodes. The pipeline pattern is formally defined
            [here](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:30).

        - Exclusive pair pattern (`.pair`):

            The exclusive pair pattern is used to connect a peer to precisely
            one other peer. This pattern is used for inter-thread communication
            across the inproc transport. The exclusive pair pattern is formally
            defined [here](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:31).

        - Native pattern (`.stream`):

            The native pattern is used for communicating with TCP peers and
            allows asynchronous requests and replies in either direction.

            calls. Each request sent is round-robined among all services, and

            If no services are available, then any send operation on the socket

            socket shall prepend a message part containing the identity of the
            originating peer to the message before passing it to the
            application. Messages received are fair-queued from among all
            connected peers. When sending messages a `.router` socket shall
            remove the first part of the message and use it to determine the
            identity of the peer the message shall be routed to. If the peer
            does not exist anymore the message shall be silently discarded by
            default, unless `(set|get)RouterMandatory` socket option is set to
            1.

            When a `.router` socket enters the mute state due to having reached
            the high water mark for all peers, then any messages sent to the
            socket shall be dropped until the mute state ends. Likewise, any
            messages routed to a peer for which the individual high water mark
            has been reached shall also be dropped.

            When a `.request` socket is connected to a `.router` socket, in
            addition to the identity of the originating peer each message
            received shall contain an empty delimiter message part. Hence, the
            entire structure of each received message as seen by the application
            becomes: one or more identity parts, delimiter part, one or more
            body parts. When sending replies to a `.request` socket the

            from a non-ØMQ peer, when using the tcp:// transport. A `.stream`
            socket can act as client and/or server, sending and/or receiving TCP
            data asynchronously.

            When receiving TCP data, a `.stream` socket shall prepend a message
            part containing the identity of the originating peer to the message
            before passing it to the application. Messages received are
            fair-queued from among all connected peers.

            When sending TCP data, a `.stream` socket shall remove the first
            part of the message and use it to determine the identity of the peer
            the message shall be routed to, and unroutable messages shall cause
            an `EHOSTUNREACH` or `EAGAIN` error.

            To open a connection to a server, use the `.connect` method call,
            and then fetch the socket identity using the `getIdentity` method
            call.

            To close a specific connection, send the identity frame followed by
            a zero-length message.

            When a connection is made, a zero-length message will be received by
            the application. Similarly, when the peer disconnects (or the
            connection is lost), a zero-length message will be received by the
            application.

            The `SocketSendRecvOption.sendMore` flag is ignored on data frames.
            You must send one identity frame followed by one data frame.

            Also, please note that omitting the `SocketSendRecvOption.sendMore`
            flag will prevent sending further data (from any client) on the same
            socket.
